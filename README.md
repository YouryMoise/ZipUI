The purpose of this program is to output an excel file that can be used to make data visualizations using platforms such as KeplerGL.
The two options are ZipCounter and ZipConverter.
If you choose ZipCounter, you can enter an excel file with individual data on each line (with the ZIP code and event attended). The program will return a sheet with several columns: the ZIP code, latitude, longitude, and one column for each event type. Each cell under the event types represents the number of people from a certain ZIP code that attended a certain event type. The latitude and longitude information allows this to be submitted into KeplerGL for visualization purposes.
If you already have a file in the format output by ZipCounter but without the coordinates, you can choose ZipConverter, which will return the same file but with columns added for latitude and longitude.
